        <section aria-labelledby="Writing modes and block and inline layout">
          <h2 id="Writing modes and block and inline layout"><a
              href="#Writing modes and block and inline layout">Writing modes and block and inline layout</a></h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>We have already discussed <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#block_and_inline_boxes">block
                and inline layout</a>, and the fact that some things display as block elements and others as inline
              elements. As we have seen described above, block and inline is tied to the writing mode of the document,
              and not the physical screen. Blocks are only displayed from the top to the bottom of the page if you are
              using a writing mode that displays text horizontally, such as English.</p>
            <p>If we look at an example this will become clearer. In this next example I have two boxes that contain a
              heading and a paragraph. The first uses <code>writing-mode: horizontal-tb</code>, a writing mode that is
              written horizontally and from the top of the page to the bottom. The second uses
              <code>writing-mode: vertical-rl</code>; this is a writing mode that is written vertically and from right
              to left.
            </p>
            <iframe style="height:70rem" src="../getting-started/started59.html"></iframe>
            <p>When we switch the writing mode, we are changing which direction is block and which is inline. In a
              <code>horizontal-tb</code> writing mode the block direction runs from top to bottom; in a
              <code>vertical-rl</code> writing mode the block direction runs right-to-left horizontally. So the
              <strong>block dimension</strong> is always the direction blocks are displayed on the page in the writing
              mode in use. The <strong>inline dimension</strong> is always the direction a sentence flows.
            </p>
            <p>This figure shows the two dimensions when in a horizontal writing mode.</p>
            <img alt="" src="../images/horizontal-tb.png" loading="lazy">
            <p>This figure shows the two dimensions in a vertical writing mode.</p>
            <img alt="" src="../images/vertical.png" loading="lazy">
            <p>Once you start to look at CSS layout, and in particular the newer layout methods, this idea of block and
              inline becomes very important. We will revisit it later on.</p>
            <p></p>

        <section aria-labelledby="Direction">
          <h3 id="Direction"><a href="#Direction">Direction</a></h3>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>In addition to writing mode we also have text direction. As mentioned above, some languages such as
              Arabic are written horizontally, but right-to-left. This is not something you are likely to use in a
              creative sense — if you simply want to line something up on the right there are other ways to do so —
              however it is important to understand this as part of the nature of CSS. The web is not just for languages
              that are displayed left-to-right!</p>
            <p>Due to the fact that writing mode and direction of text can change, newer CSS layout methods do not refer
              to left and right, and top and bottom. Instead they will talk about start and end along with this idea of
              inline and block. Don't worry too much about that right now, but keep these ideas in mind as you start to
              look at layout; you will find it really helpful in your understanding of CSS.</p>
