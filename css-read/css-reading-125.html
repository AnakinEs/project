            <p>The reason to talk about writing modes and direction at this point in your learning however, is because
              of the fact we have already looked at a lot of properties which are tied to the physical dimensions of the
              screen, and make most sense when in a horizontal writing mode.</p>
            <p>Let's take a look at our two boxes again — one with a <code>horizontal-tb</code> writing mode and one
              with <code>vertical-rl</code>. I have given both of these boxes a <code>width</code>. You can see that
              when the box is in the vertical writing mode, it still has a width, and this is causing the text to
              overflow.</p>
            <iframe style="height:70rem" src="../getting-started/started60.html"></iframe>
            <p>What we really want in this scenario, is to essentially swap height and width along with the writing
              mode. When we're in a vertical writing mode we want the box to expand in the block dimension just like it
              does in the horizontal mode.</p>
            <p>To make this easier, CSS has recently developed a set of mapped properties. These essentially replace
              physical properties — things like <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> — with
              <strong>logical</strong>, or <strong>flow relative</strong> versions.
            </p>
            <p>The property mapped to <code>width</code> when in a horizontal writing mode is called
              <code>inline-size</code> — it refers to the size in the inline dimension. The property for
              <code>height</code> is named <code>block-size</code> and is the size in the block dimension. You can see
              how this works in the example below where we have replaced <code>width</code> with
              <code>inline-size</code>.
