          <div class="section-content">
            <p>In addition to writing mode we also have text direction. As mentioned above, some languages such as
              Arabic are written horizontally, but right-to-left. This is not something you are likely to use in a
              creative sense — if you simply want to line something up on the right there are other ways to do so —
              however it is important to understand this as part of the nature of CSS. The web is not just for languages
              that are displayed left-to-right!</p>
            <p>Due to the fact that writing mode and direction of text can change, newer CSS layout methods do not refer
              to left and right, and top and bottom. Instead they will talk about start and end along with this idea of
              inline and block. Don't worry too much about that right now, but keep these ideas in mind as you start to
              look at layout; you will find it really helpful in your understanding of CSS.</p>
